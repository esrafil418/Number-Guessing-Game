# Number Guessing Game

A simple browser-based number guessing game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Players try to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The UI shows previous guesses, remaining attempts, and displays win/lose messages in a fixed, scrollable result area.

## Features

- Random number between 1 and 100
- 10 guesses per game
- Previous guesses shown as compact badges
- Remaining guesses counter
- Win and lose messages appended to a fixed result area (scrollable)
- Responsive layout with a capped width for small screens

## Files

- `index.html` - The main page and UI structure
- `style.css` - Styling and layout
- `app.js` - Game logic and DOM interaction

## How to run

1. Open the project folder in your file manager.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.

Or using PowerShell (from the project directory):

```powershell
Start-Process .\index.html
```

No build step or external dependencies are required â€” just a modern browser.
